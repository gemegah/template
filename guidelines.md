1. Core Concept: “Our Timeline → Our Choice → Our Future”

Your site should feel like walking through memories, emotions, and intention.

Three acts, like a short film:

Act I — How We Started
Act II — How We Survived Each Other 😄
Act III — Where We’re Going

Each section scrolls or animates into the next.

Soft pink → peach → lavender gradients slowly shift in the background. Nothing harsh. Everything flows.

Think: warm sunset colors, slow breathing motion, gentle music optional.

2. Visual Style (Mood Board)
Colors

Blush pink

Rose gold

Soft peach

Cream white

Light lavender

Use gradients, never flat blocks.

Example:

#FFC0CB → #FFB6C1 → #FFD1DC → #FFF0F5

Fonts

Pair:

Handwritten script (for headings)

Clean sans-serif (for text)

Examples:

Pacifico + Poppins

Dancing Script + Inter

This makes it feel personal but still modern.

3. Opening Screen (Landing Page)

First impression: emotional hook.

Layout

Full screen.
Floating hearts or particles.
Soft animation.

Text fades in:

“Hey Yolie…
This is our little corner of the internet.”

Button:
💗 “Start Our Story”

4. Act I — “Since 2020…”

Storytelling Section

Scroll animation reveals photos, dates, memories.

Content idea:

Timeline cards:

🗓️ 2020
“We met. I had no idea you’d become this important.”

🗓️ 2021–2024
“Friends. Best friends. Occasional ‘I’m not talking to you’ breaks 😅”

🗓️ Late 2025
“Somehow… we became us.”

You can add:

Screenshots of chats (blur sensitive parts)

Photos

Inside jokes

This section says: I remember our history. You matter.

5. Act II — “My Confession”

This is where vulnerability lives.

Center-aligned card with slow glow.

text with typewriter effect:

“I know I’m not perfect.
I can be dramatic.
I can be slow to act.
And yes… occasionally a full-time doofus.

I’ve fumbled moments.
I’ve hesitated when I shouldn’t have.
I’ve probably tested your patience more than once.

But loving you?
Caring about you?
Choosing you?

That part has always been clear.
That part has never been complicated.”

Then:

“Through every ‘I’m not talking to you anymore’…
we still found our way back.”

6. Act III — “The Question”

This is the climax.

Make it dramatic and playful.

Valentine Proposal Page

Big heart animation.

Text:

“So… I have a question.”

Button:
💌 “Open”

Click → animation → modal opens:

“Will you be my Valentine?”

Buttons:

Yes 💖

Of course 💕

Try Again 😆 (loops back)

No “No” button. Ever.

If she clicks any option → celebration.

Confetti.
Hearts.
Sound effect.

7. Day Two: “Girlfriend Upgrade Mode”

After Valentine, you unlock the second page.

URL like:

/level-up
/next-chapter
/us


Text:

“Yesterday was about love.
Today is about commitment.”

Then:

“Will you be my girlfriend?”

Make this more serious and intimate.

Less playful.
More sincere.

8. Easter Eggs (Personal Touches)

These make it unforgettable.

Hidden Messages

Click on stars → shows inside jokes.

Secret Page

Type her name → bonus love note.

Floating notes:

“That day you laughed at my joke…”

“Our first serious talk…”

“When I knew it was you…”

“Doofus Apology Button”

Button that plays:

“I’m sorry for being silly sometimes.
Please forgive your favorite idiot.”
